# Text-Categorization-with-SVM-CNN

This project evaluated the use of support vector machines and convolutional neural networks as the solution for text categorization.

## Datasets

* IMDB movie reviews datasetï¼šThe IMDB dataset contains movie reviews excerpted from IMDB website. 20K negative reviews and 20K positive     reviews are randomly selected to creat a total 40K reviews dataset for   sentiment classification performance evaluation.
* Amazon reviews dataset: This dataset consists of product reviews from Amazon. Similar to what we did with IMDB dataset, 20K negative       reviews and 20K positive reviews are randomly selected to creat a total 40K reviews dataset for sentiment classification performance       evaluation.
* RCV1: This dataset consists of news stories from Reuters. These news stories are originally categorized with 103 topic categories in a     hierarchy. We regroup the dataset into 8 single-label categories for multi-topic classification performance evaluation.
